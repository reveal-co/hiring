# DevOps Technical Assessment

Hi! Thank you for your interest in Reveal DevOps organization.

Our goal with this "test" is to get to understand what DevOps Engineer you are, and fuel further conversations with you so both you and our Engineering team get convinced you are the right fit for the job.

### A few questions

1. What do you think are the important steps in the delivery process? Why?
2. Exciting news! You are starting a new project, along with a few developers. What would be the first things you do? Why?
3. Tell us about one or more CI/CD tool that you like. Can you explain why you like it so much?
4. At Reveal, we use Terraform to do pretty much everything we can. What do you think about Terraform? What are its pros/cons?
